robotmachine
============

What is this?
-------------
This is a public repository of source code for a microcontrolled robot, created by students of Schoolcraft College using [Arduino](http://www.arduino.cc/) and [Processing](http://processing.org/).


What does the robot do?
-----------------------
At this point, nothing - because there's no codebase. We'll let you know the features when we make them!

Allen, please write codebase.


I like this! Can I help?
------------------------
If I know you and you would like to be a collaborator, let me know! If not, fork us!

I suggest using [GitHub for Windows](http://windows.github.com/) if you are unfamiliar with Git and/or version-control.

For those using Mac/Linux who don't like the terminal; you did this to yourself.


Structure
---------
This project is currently under construction; we'll work out how we want it built soon!


Documentation
-------------
All code written in this project should be self-documenting (i.e. very simple and well-named) and/or well-commented.

For a great guide on proper code maintenance read [this page](http://thc.org/root/phun/unmaintain.html).


What do I work on?
------------------
Check the "Issues" tab at the top of this page - it should have a list of things needed to be done/fixed.


This file
---------
This document is a .md markdown file - basically a pretty readme.

For more information on this and how to edit it, check out [this page](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/basics) and [this other page](http://github.github.com/github-flavored-markdown/).

I suggest using [Sublime Text](http://www.sublimetext.com/) as your editor, as it's awesome.


Don't dump all your folder's files here!
----------------------------------------
Be sure to use the [.gitignore](https://help.github.com/articles/ignoring-files) file, so that you only put files that *everyone* in the project will use.
